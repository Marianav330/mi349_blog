    <h1> Get to know me!</h1>
    <p> I was born and raised in Michigan, living in South Lyon my entire life. Being raised in a small town was a fun experience, and I got to enjoy the simple pleasures of things like going to the apple orchard on the weekend without even knowing how special it was. The sweet memories and friends I have in my hometown will always be carried with me. </p>
    <p> When I was a senior in Highschool, I decided that I wanted to come to Michigan State University to study Computer Science. I have a dad who is an Electrical and Software engineer, so I was always exposed to tech and engineering since I was a kid. It was a simple and easy choice for me to go into Computer Science. Choosing this field of study has broadened my understanding of many things, and I am glad I chose something that can challenge me. </p>
    <p> In my freetime, I like to do all sorts of things! Here is a list to name a few. </p>
